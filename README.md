For this assignment, I utilized XPert Learining Assistance and Ask BCS Learning.

#### Answer the following question: 

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

My answer:

Loss of Information and Dimensionality Reduction. To expand, when you reduce the number of features, you are effectively reducing the amount of information available for clustering. 
This reduction can lead to a loss of subtle patterns or nuances present in the original data. With fewer features, the clusters formed by K-Means tend to be simpler and more compact. 
This is because K-Means defines clusters based on distances between data points in the feature space. Fewer features mean fewer dimensions along which distances are calculated, potentially resulting in more spherical or less elongated clusters.
